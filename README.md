# Dimensionless in-pipe axial pico-hydraulic turbine design
This repository contains the companion code to a novel approach for the design of in-pipe pico-hydraulic turbine design. It contains the literate code of the design algorithm applied to a design example.

The included ipython notebook was intended to be uploaded to Google Drive and used with Google Colab extension, but it can be easily adapted to be used standalone.

A generated dimensionless design chart and the corresponding designed turbine is shown in figure 1 and 2.
